# Introduction 
This Kaggle project utilized Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network to identify whether an image is a cat or a dog. The CNN is built with Keras pre-trained model Xception, scoring around 90% of accuracy on validation data. 

# Data Set
###### The data source can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data]. 
In the code, I connect the dataset with Kaggle API.
